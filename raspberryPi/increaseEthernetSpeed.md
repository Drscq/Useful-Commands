# Increase Ethernet Speed on Raspberry Pi

There are two ways to increase the Ethernet speed on a Raspberry Pi:

1. USB A Ethernet adapter
2. PCIe Ethernet adapter

For the USB A Ethernet adapter, you need to buy [5Gbps USB to Ethernet Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/5Gbps-USB-Ethernet-Adapter-Converter/dp/B0FRGG55G7/ref=sr_1_9?crid=4MVR4VFY797A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.A_3Ri1GzbRxXuTnVu_pdWj7u8geFk5SKFlI79kH7VQHk1E8EEBwJULgwiWm8w4-i4o8SsJyqzLXDlr1Higa49W_fp7mWGBBiJPaBj65-z_feKvbtFLB6orIZEb-zTeynk7iKdD9npQ2RJF8W1VjmJCG5_fGefkx2mDnY3K8pxi49iLS113E0DCTIysJLw6SGf1g4_lDAtr98JRQQ241Q_5iYwb1uPQGUjxgCaqpAtuo.-YSyPqT_eDto0z_j5EzkLaf-7zXjtDim0-F857VdAWE&dib_tag=se&keywords=usb+3+to+5gbps+ethernet+adapter&qid=1765897971&sprefix=usb+3+to+5gbps+ethernet+adapter%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-9). This is the easiest way to set up. Becuase you just need to insert the adapter into the USB port and it will work.As you can see from the following image, the bandwidth between the Server and Raspberry Pi is 2.28Gbps.![USB A Ethernet Adapter](figures/USBethernetAdapter.png)

For the PCIe Ethernet adapter, you need to buy [IO Crest 10 Gigabit M.2 M Key Ethernet Network Expansion Card](https://www.amazon.com/IO-Gigabit-Ethernet-Network-Expansion/dp/B0BWSLSK78/?th=1), and [Official Pi PCIe to M.2 HAT](https://www.amazon.com/Official-Raspberry-Standard-Supports-High-Speed/dp/B0D5CGDJLQ?crid=3T12A6B3TZ7ZA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g8XKmZk49DaSAKSsLsGg_A-YcojVOTUwkF8hYJkr6_FQsbgbotNfM1AaaONp4sSFrRr4LxczXXGS6IOEAC6y6zJvMsmjYA4oxqqR7-5nY-RZfL-M4-NiedDp_BLp4oqpoZMASuJ_UX0v-Y8kJw1k0LY5J08o0t3FrvZzvX7h4z95H3ZYWwhyd2ftAHxCwfE_u4_BUTbzCCHQJcabfbrxSxoH3zBlEyvSTn5lRe4OH7c.vmrpLOGGQJd8eNvbsXLkwst-neC80Ymn1u2v8YNiKhc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Raspberry+Pi+M.2+HAT%2B&qid=1767978896&sprefix=raspberry+pi+m.2+hat%2B%2Caps%2C93&sr=8-1). We used the link of [10 Gigabit Ethernet on Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.jiribrejcha.net/2024/03/10-gigabit-ethernet-on-raspberry-pi-5/) as the reference to guide us to see what kind of equipments we need to buy to make it work and the maximum bandwidth we can get, which is 3.45 Gbps. As you can see from the following image, the bandwidth betweent eh server and the Raspberry Pi is 3.52 Gbps.![PCIe Ethernet Adapter](figures/PCIeethernetAdapter.png). I also need to note that
