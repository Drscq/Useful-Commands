Given the `CMakeLists.txt` file you provided, you need to install the **NTL (Number Theory Library)** and configure it to work with your project. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

---

### Step 1: Install GMP
First, install GMP, which is a dependency of NTL:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgmp-dev -y
```

---

### Step 2: Download and Build NTL
Download and build NTL from source:

1. **Download NTL:**
   ```bash
   wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
   cd ntl-11.5.1/src
   ```

2. **Configure NTL:**
   ```bash
   ./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on PREFIX=$HOME/local
   ```
   - `PREFIX=$HOME/local` sets the installation path for NTL to a local directory (`$HOME/local`).

3. **Build and Install NTL:**
   ```bash
   make
   make install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
   Check that the NTL library and headers are installed:
   ```bash
   ls $HOME/local/lib/libntl.a
   ls $HOME/local/include/NTL
   ```

---

### Step 3: Configure Your CMake Project
Your `CMakeLists.txt` file should work as-is, as it already specifies:
- The location of the NTL library at `${LOCAL_PREFIX}/lib/libntl.a`.
- The headers in `${LOCAL_PREFIX}/include`.

Make sure `LOCAL_PREFIX` matches the installation path (`$HOME/local`).

---

### Step 4: Build Your Project
Run the following commands to build your project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

---

### Step 5: Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. **Library Not Found:** Ensure `libntl.a` is in `$HOME/local/lib`.
2. **Include Path Errors:** Verify NTL headers are in `$HOME/local/include/NTL`.
3. **Environment Variables:** Add the library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   To make this change permanent, add it to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

After these steps, the NTL library should be properly installed, and your project should compile successfully.

It looks like you've successfully built and installed **NTL (Number Theory Library)**. Now, to ensure your compiler can find and use NTL, you should configure the paths for the compiler and linker.

## Following are the steps to set up the environment variables for NTL without customizing the installation path:
### **Next Steps:**
1. **Verify Installation**
   Run:
   ```bash
   ls -l /usr/local/lib/libntl.a
   ls -l /usr/local/include/NTL
   ```
   If the files are present, NTL has been successfully installed.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   You need to update the paths so your compiler can locate NTL.

   **For GCC/Clang:**
   ```bash
   export CPATH=/usr/local/include:$CPATH
   export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

   If you want these settings to persist, add them to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
   ```bash
   echo 'export CPATH=/usr/local/include:$CPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Test NTL Installation**  
   Create a simple C++ program (e.g., `ntl_test.cpp`):
   ```cpp
   #include <NTL/ZZ.h>
   #include <iostream>

   using namespace std;
   using namespace NTL;

   int main() {
       ZZ a, b, c;
       a = conv<ZZ>(12345);
       b = conv<ZZ>(6789);
       c = a * b;
       cout << "Multiplication result: " << c << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   Compile it using:
   ```bash
   g++ -o ntl_test ntl_test.cpp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lntl -lgmp
   ```

   Then run:
   ```bash
   ./ntl_test
   ```

   If it prints the multiplication result correctly, NTL is installed and working.
